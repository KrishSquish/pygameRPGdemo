1 2 3 4 5
player startes at 1 and ends at 4
needs to go to five
needs a constant pace 
remaining distance = rd
rn rd is 1 (1 grid space to move)
make a statement making player movement the same and break once it hitsthe gird number


rd has to be minus instead of plus


"2.	Have enemies spot you from some grid spaces away and will stop you, approach you, and initiate a battle"
make bigger hitboxes

need a way to detect ever 15 
if frame number is x>15, 15<x>30,30<x>45, 45<x>60

if opponent.defeated == False:
# draw hitboxes in loop maybe?


need to adjust delta Y so its minus whatever is being checked for in coordinate snapping maybe?
becxause there is always a little edge
